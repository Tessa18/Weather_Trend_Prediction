# Weather_Trend_Prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting global weather trends using advanced data science techniques. By leveraging machine learning models, time-series forecasting, geospatial analysis, and distributed computing with Apache Spark and SQL, it uncovers critical insights into weather patterns, correlations, and anomalies. The findings aim to support decision-making in climate studies, policy planning, and environmental sustainability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

**Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers. Normalized features for effective model training.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovered trends, seasonality, and correlations in weather metrics.

**Visualizations**: Histograms, heatmaps, and boxplots for a detailed look at weather data.

**Spark and SQL**: Used Apache Spark for large-scale data processing and SQL for efficient querying and aggregation of weather data.

**Forecasting Models**: Linear Regression, ARIMA, and LSTM implemented for temperature forecasting. Ensemble approach combining ARIMA and LSTM outputs.
